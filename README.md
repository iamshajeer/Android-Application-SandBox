In recent time there has been an increase of malicious Android applications showing up on both official and unofficial markets. If one had a tool that via sandboxing technique would provide an initial perspective on a package's behavior, one could reduce the risk of getting exposed to such malware.

To accomplish this, the sandbox will utilize static pre-check, dynamic taint analysis and API monitoring. Data leaks can be detected by tainting sensitive data and placing taint sinks throughout the API. Additionally, by logging relevant API function parameters and return values, a potential malware can be discovered and reported for further analysis.
